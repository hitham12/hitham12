        In 1870 a local guide showed French explorer Victor Guérin extensive ruins located south of Daliyat al-Karmel, called Khirbet Doubel. The ruins were the most extensive on Mount Carmel. Guérin thought it might be the town on Mt. Carmel mentioned by Pliny.[4] Conder and Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund surveyed the area and noted "traces of ruins" at a place SE of the village centre called Dubil.[5] Later excavations have found remains there from Iron Age I, Early Roman and Byzantine periods,[6] together with pottery from first century to the second–third centuries CE.[7] Although inconclusive, Lieutenant Conder thought that Daliyat al-Karmel was to be identified with the biblical Idalah (Joshua 19:15).[8]
